This is an example of what your inputs directory should look like. The 'fcs_files' folder should contain all the .fcs files listed in 'analysis_inputs.csv' and these files should have all the channels and markers listed in 'analysis_markers.csv'. If a FlowJo workspace file is named in the workspace column of 'analysis_settings.csv', include it also, and specify which gate to use in the pipeline (eg. 'Live Cells', 'Singlets', 'CD3+').
